🎓 Final Project - Advanced Database Management Systems (ADBMS)

This project is developed as part of our Advanced Database Management Systems coursework. It demonstrates a comprehensive application of advanced database concepts using Microsoft SQL Server and WAMP Server, including database design, implementation, and advanced SQL features. 📌 Project Highlights ✅ ER & EER Diagrams: Properly modeled entity-relationship and extended ER diagrams.

✅ Normalization: Data structures normalized up to 3NF to ensure efficiency and eliminate redundancy.

✅ SQL Implementation:

-Use of DDL and DML statements -Defined primary, foreign keys, and check constraints -Creation of stored procedures -Setup of triggers for automated operations -Designed and executed sequences -Use of views for specific data access layers

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Tool Purpose -SQL Server : Main DBMS used for query execution -WAMP Server : Used for web-based DB interactions -ER Modeling Tools : For creating ER and EER diagrams -SQL : For data definition & manipulation

📂 Project Contents -Entity-Relationship Diagram -Extended ER Diagram -Normalized table structures -Folder containing SQL scripts for: -Table creation -Views -Sequences -Procedures -Triggers -Constraints

📚 Outcomes -Mastered core and advanced database techniques -Understood database optimization using normalization -Developed real-world SQL procedures and triggers -Gained experience working with professional DBMS tools
